Creating servers is the fundamental part of using Pyrodactyl.

After setting up your nodes and seeing a green beating heart, you can continue with setting up servers.

## What is a Server?

A server in Pyrodactyl is a containerized application instance that runs on a Node. It consumes a defined amount of resources (CPU, memory, disk, network allocations) from its assigned Node.

## Prerequisites

-   At least one configured and online Node.
-   Available allocations (IP:Port combinations) on the chosen Node.
-   A valid Egg for the game or application you wish to run.

## Creating a Server

1.  **Navigate to the Admin Area:** From your Pyrodactyl panel, go to `Admin Area` > `Servers`.
2.  **Click "Create New":** In the top right corner, click the "Create New" button.
3.  **Fill out the Server Details:**

    -   **Server Name:** A user-friendly name for your server (e.g., "My Minecraft Survival Server").
    -   **Server Owner:** Select the user who will own and manage this server.
    -   **Description (Optional):** A brief description of the server's purpose.
    -   **Node:** Choose the Node where this server will be deployed. Ensure the Node has sufficient resources and allocations.
    -   **Allocation:** Select an available IP:Port allocation from the chosen Node. This is how users will connect to your server.
    -   **Egg:** Select the appropriate Egg for the game or application (e.g., "Minecraft: Java Edition").
    -   **Nest:** The Nest associated with the chosen Egg will be automatically selected.

4.  **Configure Resources:**

    -   **Memory (MiB):** The maximum amount of RAM the server can use.
    -   **Swap (MiB):** The amount of swap space available. Set to `-1` for unlimited.
    -   **Disk Space (MiB):** The maximum amount of disk space the server can use.
    -   **CPU Limit (%):** The percentage of a single CPU core the server can use (e.g., `100` for one thread, `200` for two cores).
    -   **IO Weight:** Adjusts the I/O priority for the server (10-1000, default 500).

5.  **Configure Startup Parameters:**

    -   **Startup Command:** The command used to start the server. This is usually pre-filled by the Egg.
    -   **Service Variables:** Additional variables defined by the Egg that can be configured (e.g., server JAR file, difficulty).

6.  **Advanced Settings (Optional):**

    -   **Database Limit:** Maximum number of databases the server owner can create.
    -   **Allocation Limit:** Maximum number of additional allocations the server owner can create. (in the [network tab](/post-install/users/servers/network))
    -   **Backup Limit:** Maximum number of backups the server owner can create.
    -   **OOM Killer:** Enable or disable the Out-Of-Memory killer for this server.

7.  **Click "Create Server":** Once all details are filled, click the button to create the server.

The server will now be provisioned on the selected Node. You can monitor its status and manage it from the server list.

## Managing Servers

Once a server is created, the user that is assigned the server can perform various management tasks:
<Callout type="note">
    Admins can still manage and access servers, they will apear under "other servers" when on the homepage of the panel
</Callout>

-   **Start/Stop/Restart:** Control the server's power state.
-   **Console:** View server logs and send commands.
-   **Files:** Access and manage server files via SFTP or the web interface.
-   **Databases:** Create and manage MySQL databases for the server.
-   **Schedules:** Set up automated tasks (e.g., daily backups, restarts).
-   **Network:** Manage additional IP allocations and port forwarding.
-   **Subusers:** Grant other users access to manage specific aspects of the server.
-   **Settings:** Modify server resource limits, startup parameters, and other configurations.
-   **Backups:** Create, restore, and manage server backups.

## Best Practices

-   **Resource Allocation:** Allocate resources carefully. Over-allocating can lead to resource exhaustion on the Node, while under-allocating can cause server performance issues.
-   **Security:** Regularly update server software and use strong passwords for SFTP and database access.
-   **Backups:** Implement a regular backup strategy to prevent data loss.
-   **Monitoring:** Keep an eye on server resource usage and logs to identify and resolve issues proactively.
-   **Eggs:** Ensure you are using up-to-date and well-maintained Eggs for your applications.

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Server won't start | Insufficient resources on Node | Check Node capacity and reduce server limits or add resources |
| Port binding errors | Allocation already in use or bind IP incorrect | Use `0.0.0.0` as bind address, verify port is free on Node |
| Out of Memory crashes | Memory limit too low for application | Increase memory allocation or enable swap |
| Server stuck in "Installing" | Egg installation script failed | Check server logs, verify Egg is up-to-date |
| Cannot connect to server | Firewall blocking ports or wrong allocation | Verify Node firewall rules allow the server's port |
| SFTP connection fails | Wrong SFTP port or Node unreachable | Verify Node's SFTP port (default 2022) is open and correct |
| Slow file uploads | Upload size limit too restrictive | Increase Node's upload size limit in settings |
| Database creation fails | Database limit reached | Increase database limit or remove unused databases |
| Startup command errors | Invalid variables or missing files | Review Egg configuration and service variables |
| Backup fails | Insufficient disk space or backup limit reached | Free up disk space or increase backup limit |

### Troubleshooting Tips

-   **Check Server Logs:** Most issues and their situations are in the server logs themselves. 
-   **Verify Node Status:** Ensure the Node has a green heartbeat and correct resources.
-   **Review Egg Configuration:** Ensure the Egg is compatible with the application version you're trying to use.
-   **Resource Monitoring:** Use Node metrics to find resource bottlenecks (CPU, RAM, disk I/O).

### When to Contact Support

If you've verified all settings and the issue persists:
-   Check the [Common Issues](/common-issues/bind-issues) section for detailed troubleshooting guides.
-   Review [Pyrodactyl Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FGWKZT5dxv?utm_campaign=pyrodactyl_support) for similar issues.
-   Gather server logs, Node status, and error messages before seeking help.
