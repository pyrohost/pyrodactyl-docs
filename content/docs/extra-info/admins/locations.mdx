## What Is a Location?

In Pyrodactyl a Location is a highâ€“level grouping used to classify Nodes by geography, datacenter, or provider. It is purely organizational and does not itself run any workloads.

## Location vs Node

- Location: Logical label (no hardware, no allocations).
- Node: Actual machine configuration (daemon, allocations, resource limits) that is assigned to exactly one Location.

## Creating a Location

1. Go to Admin Area > Locations.
2. Click Create Location.
3. Provide:
    - Short Code: Concise identifier (e.g. us-nyc-1).
    - Description (optional but recommended).
4. Save.

Short Codes should be:
- Lowercase
- Hyphen separated
- Stable (avoid later renames if referenced externally)

Examples: us-east, us-east-2, eu-fra, ap-sgp, edge-la, aws-usw-1, us.chicago.pyro 

## Assigning Nodes

When adding or editing a Node select the desired Location. Reassigning a Node later does not affect servers functionally; it only updates grouping.

## Editing & Renaming

- You may edit description anytime.
- Renaming the short code is safe internally but may break external automation that relies on the old code--audit before changing.

## Deleting a Location

- You must first move or remove all Nodes under it.
- Deletion leaves servers intact (they live under their Nodes) but you cannot delete if any Node still references the Location.

## Best Practices

- Keep list small and meaningful (regions/providers, not every rack).
- Use consistent pattern (region-city-number or provider-region).
- Avoid embedding transient info (like temporary offers or hardware specs).
- Document naming scheme for staff.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Impact | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Too many granular Locations | Cluttered UI | Merge into broader regions |
| Using Location to reflect hardware tier | Confusion | Use Node naming / descriptions instead |
| Renaming without notice | Automation breakage | Maintain a mapping or avoid rename |

## API Notes

Locations are retrievable and manageable via the administrative API. Create Locations first, then post Nodes referencing the Location ID or short code (depending on endpoint requirements).

## When to Add Another Location

Add a new Location only if:
- New geographic region introduced
- New provider with distinct compliance / cost profile
- You need a clear segregation boundary for reporting

If it is just a new machine in an existing region/provider, add another Node--not a Location.

## Quick Checklist

- Does it represent a distinct region or provider? (Yes -> Location)
- Will staff readily understand the code? (Yes -> Good)
- Will it stay relevant for 6+ months? (Yes -> Proceed).

After all of that you are done! Your location is made and now you can see it in the main locations page.
