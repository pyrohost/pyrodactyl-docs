It is highly recommended that you use the offical Blueprint page to configure your environment variables.
Additionally, most of the instructions on this page are based on the offical Blueprint page which typically means that the offical page is more up to date.
Those instructions can all be found [here](https://blueprint.zip/guides/admin/install).

## Step 1 - Define Pyrodactyl Directory
First you need to set an environment variable for the blueprint script to use.
```bash
# Use this command to set a $PYRODACTYL_DIRECTORY variable
# for use later in this guide.
export PYRODACTYL_DIRECTORY=/var/www/pyrodactyl
```

## Step 2 - Download & Install Blueprint
```bash
# Navigate to your Pyrodactyl directory
cd $PYRODACTYL_DIRECTORY

# Download and unzip Blueprint's latest release
wget "$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/pyrodactyl-oss/blueprint-framework/releases/latest | grep 'browser_download_url' | cut -d '"' -f 4)" -O $PYRODACTYL_DIRECTORY/release.zip
unzip -o release.zip
```

## Step 3 - Configure Blueprint
```bash
# Creates a .blueprintrc file in your Pyrodactyl directory
touch $PYRODACTYL_DIRECTORY/.blueprintrc
```
Now modify `$WEBUSER`, `$OWNERSHIP` and `$USERSHELL` to match the values of your environment. Here is the example from the offical Blueprint page.
```bash
# Writes data to your .blueprintrc file
echo \
'WEBUSER="www-data";
OWNERSHIP="www-data:www-data";
USERSHELL="/bin/bash";' > $PYRODACTYL_DIRECTORY/.blueprintrc
```

If you are confused about the values of these variables, please refer to the [official Blueprint page](https://blueprint.zip/guides/admin/install#configure-blueprint) for more information.
</Callout>

## Step 4 - Run Blueprint
All thats left now is to run `blueprint.sh` to finalize the installation.
```bash
# Give blueprint.sh execute permissions
chmod +x $PYRODACTYL_DIRECTORY/blueprint.sh

# Run blueprint.sh
bash $PYRODACTYL_DIRECTORY/blueprint.sh
```

Now you should be able to enjoy Blueprint and download plugins to your heart's desire!
