<Callout type='info'>
For Blueprint-specific issues, please notify `@flyingcopper` in the `#blueprint-support` channel. I will do my best to help you out. Please don't ask any other maintainer for help as they are not responsible for Blueprint.

<Callout type='warning'>
More installation instructions will be added in the future. For now, there is a native and Docker installation guide.
