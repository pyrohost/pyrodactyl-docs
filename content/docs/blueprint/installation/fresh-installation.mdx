You can jump down to the [TLDR](#tldr) section if you want to get started right away.
</Callout>

## Getting Started
First, create a folder (ex. `pyrodactyl-panel-blueprint`) on your server in a safe location. This folder will be used to store all the files for Pyrodactyl and Blueprint.

### Choosing Docker Compose File
Next, you will have to decide the docker-compose file you would like to use. You have two options:
* [`classic-docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/pyrodactyl-oss/blueprint-docker/blob/main/classic-docker-compose.yml) - This stays as close to the original pterodactyl docker-compose file as possible.
* [`docker-compose.yml (recommended)`](https://github.com/pyrodactyl-oss/blueprint-docker/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) - This is a more improved version of the docker-compose file. It is recommended that you choose this file if you are not sure.

Once you decide on the docker-compose file, you will have to download it to your server to the folder you created in the previous step.

<Callout type='info'>
The installation guide will be using the recommended docker-compose file. The process is the same for both files.
</Callout>

### Configuring Docker Compose File
As this guide will follow the recommended docker-compose file, you will have to also download the [`.env`](https://github.com/pyrodactyl-oss/blueprint-docker/blob/main/.env) file.

<Callout type='warning'>
If you are using the `classic-docker-compose.yml`, there is no need to install this file.
</Callout>

The file should look like this:
```properties
BASE_DIR=/srv/pyrodactyl
# By default, you'd want to place your Wings config.yml file at /srv/pyrodactyl/wings/config.yml
# In general, such as with this and with certs, you'd want to look at your mounts in the docker-compose.yml file
# in order to know where to put things on the host system.
APP_NAME=
APP_ENV=production # "production" or "testing"
PANEL_PORT=443
# If you want to allow port 80 as well, i.e. if you don't use Cloudflare to manage your DNS and
# automatically direct requests to https, you can add another port in the docker-compose.yml file
WINGS_PORT=8080
WINGS_SFTP_PORT=2022
# Domain for mail sections (if you're configuring email)
DOMAIN=example.com
# Recommended strength is a random 20 digit password with letters, numbers, and symbols
# You can use "openssl rand -base64 32" to generate a random password
MARIADB_ROOT_PASS=
MARIADB_USER_PASS=
VALKEY_PASS=
HASH_SALT=
...
```

You can make your adjustments now to the `.env` file.

### Start Docker Containers
Once you have configured the docker-compose file, you can start the containers by running the following command:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Creating Panel User
Now that the panel is running, its time to make your first panel user. This user will be the admin user for the panel.
```bash
docker compose exec panel php artisan p:user:make
```

Now, you can check that the panel is accessible using the IP address or domain of your server.

## TLDR
```bash
mkdir pyrodactyl-panel-blueprint
cd pyrodactyl-panel-blueprint

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrodactyl-oss/blueprint-docker/main/docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyrodactyl-oss/blueprint-docker/main/.env

# Edit the .env file to your liking
nano .env

docker compose up -d
docker compose exec panel php artisan p:user:make
```

Now navigate to the IP or domain of your panel.
