## Migrating from Pyrodactyl (Docker)
<Callout type='warning'>
Always ensure that you make a backup of your Pyrodactyl database and any other relevant data. Provided below is how you can make a backup of your Panel Database. (Replace ``panel`` with the database name you use)

```
# If using MySQL
mysqldump -u root -p --opt panel > ./panel.sql

# If using MariaDB
mariadb-dump -u root -p --opt panel > ./panel.sql
```
</Callout>

If you already have Pyrodactyl running in Docker, update your panel image and add these volumes to your `docker-compose.yml` file:
```diff
panel:
   -image: ghcr.io/pyrohost/pyrodactyl:main
   +image: ghcr.io/pyrodactyl-oss/blueprint:latest

volumes:
    + - "/srv/pyrodactyl/extensions/:/blueprint_extensions"
    + - "app:/app"
```

<Callout type='error'>
Switching back from Blueprint to Pyrodactyl is not supported. We do not provide any support for this and cant guarantee that it will work. If you care about your data, **make a backup** before switching.
</Callout>
