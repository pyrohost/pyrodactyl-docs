## Migrating from Pyrodactyl (Docker)
<Callout type='warning'>
Always make sure you take a backup of your Pterodactyl database and other relevant data.
</Callout>

If you already have Pyrodactyl running in Docker, simply update your panel image in your `docker-compose.yml` file:
```diff
-image: ghcr.io/pyrohost/pyrodactyl:main
+image: ghcr.io/pyrodactyl-oss/blueprint:latest
```

<Callout type='error'>
Switching back from Blueprint to Pyrodactyl is not supported. We do not provide any support for this and cant guarantee that it will work. If you care about your data, **make a backup** before switching.
