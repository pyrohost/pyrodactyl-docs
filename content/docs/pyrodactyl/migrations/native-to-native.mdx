## Migrating from Pterodactyl (Native → Native)

<Callout type='error'>
Once you switch to Pyrodactyl, switching back to Pterodactyl is not supported and may cause errors as Pyrodactyl modifies the Pterodactyl Database Schema. Provided below is how you can make a backup of your Panel Database if you need to switch back. It is also recommended that you make a backup of the Pterodactyl folder aswell if anything goes wrong during migration. (Replace ``panel`` with the database name you use)

```
# If using MySQL
mysqldump -u root -p --opt panel > ./panel.sql

# If using MariaDB
mariadb-dump -u root -p --opt panel > ./panel.sql
```
</Callout>

### Prerequisites

- Root or sudo access on your Linux server
- Latest [NodeJS LTS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed
- Composer installed globally
- MySQL database access and credentials
- Backup of `.env` and your current database

### Migration Steps

1. Install a Node Version Manager
    
    ```bash
    curl -o- https://fnm.vercel.app/install | bash
    ```

1. Install Node 22

    ```bash
    fnm install 22
    ```

1. Navigate to the directory where your current Pterodactyl panel is installed

    ```bash
    cd /var/www/pterodactyl
    ```

1. Put the panel into maintenance mode

    ```bash
    php artisan down
    ```

1. Download and extract the latest Pyrodactyl release:

    ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/pyrohost/pyrodactyl/releases/latest/download/panel.tar.gz | tar -xzv
    ```

1. Set proper permissions:

    ```bash
    chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache
    ```

1. Install PHP dependencies:

    ```bash
    composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
    ```

1. Clear cached views and configuration:

    ```bash
    php artisan view:clear
    php artisan config:clear
    ```

1. Run the database migrations:

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed --force
    ```

1. Set ownership to the web server user:

    ```bash
    chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/pterodactyl/*
    ```

1. Restart the queue worker:

    ```bash
    php artisan queue:restart
    ```

1. Build the frontend assets:

    ```bash
    npm install -g corepack@latest
    corepack enable pnpm
    pnpm i --frozen-lockfile && pnpm run ship
    chmod -R 755 storage/* bootstrap/cache/
   ```

1. Bring the panel back online:

    ```bash
    php artisan up
    ```

🎉 **Boom! Your panel is now migrated to Pyrodactyl!**
