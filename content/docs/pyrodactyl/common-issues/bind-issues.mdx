# Troubleshooting Port Binding Issues

If your service or game server is failing to start because of **port binding errors**, follow these steps to resolve the problem.

<Callout title="Subdomain on 0.0.0.0" type='info'>
  If you need Subdomains to work while using `0.0.0.0` for IPs, You can set an address alias and turn on `Domain by Allocation Alias` in your node config
</Callout>


## 1. Check Your Bind Address

The most common cause of binding errors is the bind address being set incorrectly.

* ✅ Correct: `0.0.0.0`
* ❌ Incorrect: Your public IP (e.g., `192.168.x.x` or `123.45.67.89`)

**Why?**
Using `0.0.0.0` tells the service to listen on *all available network interfaces*. If you bind directly to your public IP, the server may fail to start if that IP is not available on the host system.

There are cases where this may not be the case. but you won't have these problems if so.

Always make sure your allocation (bind IP) is set to:

```
0.0.0.0
```

## 2. Verify the Port is Free

Run this command on the host to check if another process is already using the port:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :<PORT>
```

or

```bash
netstat -tulpn | grep <PORT>
```

If something else is using the port, either:

* Stop the other process, or
* Change your service/game server to a different port.

---

## 3. Confirm Allocations in Your Panel

If you are using a control panel:

* Make sure the **IP allocation** is `0.0.0.0`.
* Verify the **port allocation** matches what the service is configured to use.

---

## 5. Firewall & Security Groups

If the server starts successfully but you cannot connect:

* Ensure the port is allowed in your firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw allow <PORT>/tcp
```
