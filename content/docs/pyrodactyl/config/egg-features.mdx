## Minecraft Modding/plugin Support
### Pyrodactyl provides robust support for Minecraft modding/plugin platforms:

  These are dynamic Features. they are loaded by prefixing them with either `plugin/` or `mod/`.
The prefix tells pyrodactyl what folder to put your downloaded mod or plugin into it's also 
there as an identifier for the frontend system. What matters mor than that though, is
what you put after it. If you have an egg for something like [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity)
You can do that with `plugin/velocity`.
The system will do it's best to auto match it to a loader found via the modrinth api.
