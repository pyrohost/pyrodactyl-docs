Key Features and Changes:

- Deduplicated Backups
<Callout type="info" title="What are Deduplicated Backups?"> 
  Deduplication is the procecss of only storing a piece of data once.
  In the same way git works, we use an open source program called [Rustic](https://github.com/rustic-rs/rustic)
  to ensure your backups are both Encrypted, and as small as possible, all while still maintaining their integrity.
